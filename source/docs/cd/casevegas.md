# CaseVegas

## Scenario

In [this CyberDefenders challenge](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/70) you are a SOC analyst, and you have been instructed to find a suspect who was employed in a major hotel chain and was responsible for the theft of US$ 3.5 million from his employers.

When you were given the instruction, you were busy with another investigation and immediately abandoned that to start this new investigation. You were also meant to be home hours ago to take your loved one to a nice restaurant for a well-deserved dinner and relaxation time.

During the investigation, your attempt to find the suspect was recorded in the included video. Analyze the video and other files and try to extract answers for some of the case questions.

## Instructions:

* Unzip the challenge (pass: cyberdefenders.org)
* Use a media player like VLC so you can increase video playing speed to save your time.
* We recommend going through all questions once before answering questions. This way, you can watch the video evidence file once and extract answers.

## Tools used
