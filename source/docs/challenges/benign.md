One of the clientâ€™s IDS indicated a potentially suspicious process execution indicating one of the hosts from the 
HR department was compromised. Some tools related to network information gathering/scheduled tasks were executed 
which confirmed the suspicion. Due to limited resources, we could only pull the process execution logs with 
Event ID: `4688` and ingested them into Splunk with the index `win_eventlogs` for further investigation.

The network is divided into three logical segments. 

IT Department:

* James
* Moin
* Katrina

HR department:

* Haroon
* Chris
* Diana

Marketing department:

* Bell
* Amelia
* Deepak
