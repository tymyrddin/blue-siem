# Command and control phase

The attacker uploaded the file to the server to deface it. While doing so, the attacker used a Dynamic DNS to 
resolve a malicious IP. The objective in this phase would be to find the IP that the attacker decided the DNS.

To investigate the communication to and from the adversary's IP addresses, examine the network-centric log sources. 
First pick `fortigate_utm` to review the firewall logs and then move on to the other log sources.

    index=botsv1 sourcetype=fortigate_utm"poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg"

Look at the fields on the left panel and the field `url` contains the `FQDN` (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

Verify the answer by looking at another log `source.stream:http`.

    index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:http dest_ip=23.22.63.114 "poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg" src_ip=192.168.250.70

Confirm the domain by looking at the last log source `stream:dns` to see what DNS queries were sent from the webserver d
uring the infection period.

## Questions

This attack used dynamic DNS to resolve to the malicious IP. 
**What fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is associated with this attack?**
