**To maintain persistence in the Frothly network, Taedonggang APT configured several Scheduled Tasks to beacon back to their C2 server. What single webpage is most contacted by these Scheduled Tasks? Answer example: `index.php` or `images.html`**

    index="botsv2" schtasks.exe sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" 
    | dedup ParentCommandLine 
    | table ParentCommandLine CommandLine

That gives path to query in registry:

    index="botsv2" source="winregistry" "\\Software\\Microsoft\\Network"

For these events, decode the base64 data in cyberchef, until answer is found.
