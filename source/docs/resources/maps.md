# Threat maps

While these threat maps have no practical usage for defence, threat maps can be used to study past attack 
styles. Plus, some are beautiful and/or fun to watch.

Mind that the source of an attack is often forged, which means that it appears as though it was initiated from a 
certain country, but it is not from that country at all. The largest attacks usually originate from high bandwidth 
nations, who are perfectly suited to launching huge attacks from thousands of infected devices directed from other 
locations.
